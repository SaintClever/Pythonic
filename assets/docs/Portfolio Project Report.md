### Pythonic Report

- In a word processing application of your choice (such as MS Word or Google Docs), write a report that answers the following questions:

1. What game have you decided for your portfolio project? If you're having a hard time choosing, choose an open-ended game such as a text adventure/choose-your-own-adventure, or one of the other examples given in Week 1.
2. Consider the Python data structures you have learned this week, in relation to your project idea. What are some kinds of data in your project, and what would you guess would be the best way to store that data?
3. Examples:

- If you have a card game, you might store card values in a list or dictionary.
- If you have a choose-your-own-adventure game, you might have a list of characters that the player might encounter in the game.
- What are the values you might store in a data structure, versus a primitive such as an Integer or Boolean?

5. Based on what you have learned so far, write or rewrite the high-level algorithm for your game. You do not need to use code to write this. You can use pseudocode, or regular English to describe each step of your game.
6. **TIP!**Â If you are looking for more functionality to add to your game, here are some ideas:

- Keep a high score count, or leaderboard with player names (for the current session since we have not discussed saving data to files; for more advanced Pythonistas, you can try saving the high score/leaderboard to a file).
- Set a maximum number of total losses before the game automatically quits.
- Add a way for two players at the same computer to play against each other by taking turns at the keyboard.
- Try to think of other functionality you could add!

### Instructions

1. **Publish your report in this forum** by copying and pasting the text into a new post.
2. **Review your classmates' reports**, provide feedback, and ask questions.
3. **Begin coding!** You will not need to turn in any code this week, but you can get started writing the code, based on your algorithm.
